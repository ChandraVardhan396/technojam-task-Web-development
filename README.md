Web Development Task For Technojam

# How did you approach your task?

To begin, I created an HTML file and structured the basic page layout using various elements such as <div>, <img>, headings, buttons, and links. Following that, I developed a CSS file and linked it to the HTML using the <link> tag to apply styling. I proceeded to design the entire page layout with CSS. I also embedded some JavaScript within the HTML using the <script> tag to implement basic functionalities, such as toggling between images and opening new windows, without relying on the <a> tag.

# What challenges did you face?

Since this was a basic web page, I didnâ€™t encounter any significant challenges in getting it to function correctly.

# A bit about myself:

I am Chandra Vardhan Singh. I began my journey as a developer in 2017 by creating a game using Unity3D and C#. In 2018, I launched the game Teleporter Shoot: Mobile on the Google Play Store under the brand Jeunissemble.India, which surpassed 10,000 downloads. Over the years, I have won 15+ international metaverse contests and recognition as one of the top 30 metaverse creators worldwide. After my contest successes, I founded Jeunissemble Studios in Decentraland, which has since become one of the top 3 studios globally by project count. I have delivered over 35 projects in Decentraland and collaborated with other metaverses such as Sandbox, TCG World, and Spatial.io, and continue to work actively within the Decentraland ecosystem.
